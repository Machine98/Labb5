    In this package, the general classes reside that use the abstract ones.
    Here we have our specific events that are created during the simulation,
    as well as the state of the store that holds our data necessary for storeview
    to print out our results. In this package we also have calculators using uniformrandomstream
    and exponentialrandomstream as interface to randomize time in events.
