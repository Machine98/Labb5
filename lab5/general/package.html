    In this package, the abstract classes reside that are used in the general simulation. All except FIFO, EventQueue och Simulator.
    The abstract classes are created to be used as templates for the events and the state of the store. As for FIFO, it is a first
    in first out program. This class is extended by EventQueue to enable more functionality, the same goes for the CustomerQueue.
    Simulator is the class that runs the whole simulation/simulations.
